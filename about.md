I am Sri Kolagani, an aspiring Salesforce developer living in Bay Area, California. I have three fantastic years of Salesforce development experience in different roles: developer, admin and freelancer. I started Salesforce as a part-time freelancer on Upwork during my Graduate school days at California State University, Chico. Through my career fair, I was fortunate to work on real-time SFDC projects in BayArea for companies like Intuitive Surgical and Hitachi. With my experience, my interest in pursuing a career as Salesforce developer also spiked up. This blog is my initiative to motivate anyone and everyone with a thought of becoming a Salesforce developer. Here I will be sharing all my knowledge, code samples and resourceful information with a hope to motivate people around me to come join the Salesforce Ohana. 

Below links offer quick teasers of my skillsets, interests and background.
