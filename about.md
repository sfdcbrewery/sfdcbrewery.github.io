### Director of CRM Engineering, Elastic | AI & Enterprise Architecture Researcher | Salesforce Application Architect

As the Director of CRM Engineering at Elastic, I lead distributed engineering teams to deliver scalable enterprise solutions supporting Sales, Service, Marketing, and Partner Operations. Based in Dallas, Texas, my work centres on optimising CRM platforms and driving the adoption of emerging technologies—specifically agentic AI and Agentforce—to enhance operational effectiveness.

### Professional Background

My technical trajectory began in freelance development and evolved through critical roles at major organisations including Western Union, Intuitive Surgical, and Hitachi Vantara. Prior to joining Elastic, I served as a Senior Member of Technical Staff and Engineering Manager at Salesforce, where I contributed to internal scrum teams facilitating scale for global business customers.

### Academic Research

Academically, I am a DBA Scholar at GlobalNxt University. My research investigates the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, CRM systems, and technology adoption frameworks. This scholarly work builds upon an MBA in Enterprise Information Systems obtained from California State University, Chico.
