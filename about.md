## Sri Hari Deep Kolagani
# Director of CRM Engineering, Elastic | AI & Enterprise Architecture Researcher | Salesforce Application Architect

I am the Director of CRM Engineering at Elastic, where I lead distributed engineering teams to deliver scalable enterprise solutions that support Sales, Service, Marketing, and Partner Operations. Based in Dallas, Texas, I specialize in optimising CRM platforms and driving the adoption of emerging technologies, including agentic AI and Agentforce, to enhance operational effectiveness. Prior to Elastic, I served as a Senior Member of Technical Staff and Engineering Manager at Salesforce, contributing to internal scrum teams that facilitated scaling for global business customers. My technical journey began as a freelancer and evolved through key roles at major organisations such as Western Union, Intuitive Surgical, and Hitachi Vantara.

Academically, I am a DBA Scholar at GlobalNxt University, focusing my research on AI, CRM, and technology adoption frameworks. This builds upon my MBA in Enterprise Information Systems from California State University, Chico. A frequent contributor to the technical community, I am a five-time Dreamforce speaker, three-time TrailblazerDX speaker, and a featured presenter at conferences such as DevFest. I also founded SFDC Brewery, an initiative dedicated to mentoring aspiring Salesforce ohana.
